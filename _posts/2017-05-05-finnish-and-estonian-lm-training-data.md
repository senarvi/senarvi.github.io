### Conversational Finnish and Estonian data sets

Here are a couple of data sets that I have collected from the web for training
language models:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/gckrscbkuilfvhm/73M-conversational-finnish.txt.gz">
      Conversational Finnish (73 million words, 197 MB)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/kodlx8maserea3x/80M-conversational-estonian.txt.gz">
      Conversational Estonian (80 million words, 204 MB)</a></li>
</ul>

The data sets have been normalized and filtered, duplicate lines have been
removed, and the sentences have been shuffled.
